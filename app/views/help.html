    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Registering for Defra services</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your Defra account will allow you to access the services provided by Defra and related agencies and public bodies.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You need to use or create your own Government Gateway sign in details (a Government Gateway user ID and password). Do not use shared company details. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Having your own set of sign in details will save you time.  We will store basic information about you in Your Defra account so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you want to use a new online service.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Before you start</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">You will need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your email address, phone number and postal address</li>
      <li>your Government Gateway user ID and password (if you already have an account, if not you will be guided to create one)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you are registering on behalf of a business or organisation, you will also need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
